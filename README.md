### Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I am a AI driven Data science MSc graduate.
Holding reposotories are to keep track of my academic work that can be displayed as well as keep a track of my personal work to show to the world.

As programming goes, there are a lot of similar problems that people are facing, if you happen to stumble accorss a similar problem solved within one of my repos dont hesitate to explore and use. Most of it is documented such that anyone should understand my thoughts processes so should not be an issue.

Currently there is a lot that i am working on... 
If you are interested in any of the repos, make sure to read the readme.txt file first, outlining an abstract overview as well as in-depth outlook of what is currently going on with the repo, whats been finished and whats still in development with a reason behind it :D

Im always open to some open source work if any comes by. 
If youd like to get a hold of me for whatever reason, my email is: maciejrzeznicki29@gmail.com

Note most of this github repos and profile needs a tidy clean up. As there is a lot that i am working on, its sometimes difficult to find time, however do attempt to make progress in that regard whenever i can!

Hope you all the best and happy coding!
